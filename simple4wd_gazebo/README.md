# simple4wd_gazebo
A ROS package to simulate the simple4wd model in gazebo.


# Exporting Models
In order for models to be seen by Gazebo, they need to be seen on the GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH environment variable. This is set in package.xml. See [here](http://gazebosim.org/tutorials/?tut=ros_roslaunch#Exportingmodelpathsfromapackage.xml) for more details.
